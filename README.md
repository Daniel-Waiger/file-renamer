# File Renamer

This Python script provides a robust solution for renaming files by removing common and redundant parts while preserving unique identifiers.
It is especially useful for files generated by software that adds repetitive substrings.
The tool includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to select the input folder, filter files by suffix, preview the old and new filenames, and confirm the renaming process.
This ensures an efficient and user-friendly experience for managing and organizing your files.
